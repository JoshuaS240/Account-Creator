# Account Creator

A school technician requires a program that will generate accounts for new year 7 students. 

The program will need to:

* Generate usernames  
   
* Calculate year groups
   
* Verify secure passwords

Fork this Repository and open your version in Visual Studio 2022

Add the missing features to the program and verify it works using the unit test file.

You must write additional tests for each of the 3 main program requirements.

Add the link to your Repository to the document in the Teams Assignment.
